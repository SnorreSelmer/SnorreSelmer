- 👋 Hi, I’m @SnorreSelmer
- 👀 I’m interested in aviation, Golang, containerization, servers and networking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and TypeScript
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything, but I might still reach out if I find your code useful, and have something to contribute
- 📫 How to reach me: By direct message here on GitHub. I try to keep my internet footprint to a minimum, so I'm not going to list 50 social-media platform-links here.
 - I do have a Bluesky though: https://bsky.app/profile/snorreselmer.no
